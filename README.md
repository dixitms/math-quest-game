# ➕ Math Quest: Interactive Learning Game

An interactive, browser-based math game designed for kids to practice operations through gamified mechanics. Built with **Phaser 3**, it features dynamic difficulty, streak multipliers, and local high-score tracking.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Dynamic Math Engine

The game generates random problems across multiple categories. As the player's score increases, the game **Levels Up**, introducing more complex operations:

* **Level 1:** Basic Addition and Subtraction.
* **Level 2:** Multiplications (up to 12x12).
* **Level 3:** Squares ().
* **Level 4+:** Square Roots () and Cubes ().

### 2. Gamification & Juiciness

* **Streak Multiplier:** Consecutive correct answers increase your point multiplier (up to ). Making a mistake resets the streak.
* **Animations:** Smooth entrance transitions using "Elastic" easing and visual feedback (shakes) for incorrect answers.
* **Sound Synthesis:** Real-time audio generation (Dings, Buzzes, and Level-up chimes) using the Web Audio API—no external assets required.

### 3. Session Management

* **Dual Timers:** Tracks total session duration and a countdown per question.
* **State Control:** Features to **Pause**, **Restart**, and **Resume** the game at any time.
* **Leaderboard:** Saves high scores and player names to the browser's `localStorage`.
